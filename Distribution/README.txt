Codon Distribution

Measurement of the codons global ditribution in a fasta-format file, or local distribution for its sequences.


Usage:
distribution.py [-h] -F <example.fasta> -O <output.csv> [--global]
-h, --help (optional): Show help message and exit
-F, --fasta (required): Fasta file to be analyzed
-O, --output (required): output path in CSV format
--global (optional): Use in order to measure the global codon distribution instead of local distribution for its sequences.
